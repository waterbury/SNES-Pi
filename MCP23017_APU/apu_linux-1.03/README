--- Overview
This is Apuplay for linux, a simple command line
tool and an xmms plugin to load a spc to a real 
snes APU connected to the PC parallel port to 
playback music.

This program is based on APUPLAY, the equivalent
win32 program written by CaithSith2.

Useful code from the dll has been reused here, and
the VB part of the code has been converted to C. 

---- Features
This program partially supports id666 tags, stops the song
after the specified timeout (id666, default or custom), displays
the title, remaining time, etc...
